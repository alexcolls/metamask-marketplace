This repository is related to the [upcoming] tutorial. It contains the boilerplates code for a functioning Ethereum NFT marketplace.

## Prerequisites
- Metamask

## Installation

Install the node packages:

```bash
yarn install
```

Compile the Smart Contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

You have two ways to interact with the NFT Marketplace:
- Locally using Hardhat
- Deploying the contracts on Polygon Mumbai-testnet

## Deploying the NFTMarketplace locally

Open your terminal and run:
```bash
npx hardhat node
```

This will start a local Ethereum blockchain node, log 19 wallets and their private keys.

Now in a new terminal window run:

```bash
npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
This will deploy the contracts on the local ethereum node and print out their addresses (see: change contracts address section)

## Deploying the NFTMarketplace on Polygon Mumbai
As is, the contracts contained in the repository, are already deployed on Polygon Mumbai-testnet. 

If you want to work with brand new contracts, though, you'll need to:
1. Navigate to hardhat.config.js file in the root folder and substitute the private key, with your wallet's private key.

2. Get some test MATIC from an online faucet such as [this one](https://faucet.polygon.technology/)

Once you'll have both, run the following code in your terminal:
```bash
npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai
```
This will log the address of the newly deployed contracts.

Refer to the next section to learn how to change the contracts adress the front-end will interact with.


### Change The NFT Marketplace Contracts Adresses
Navigate to /pages/utils/options.js and substitute the contracts addresses with new ones.
